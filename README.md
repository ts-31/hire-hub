# HireHub

**HireHub** is a resume management and shortlisting system for recruiters and HRs.  
Recruiters can upload resumes, run a matching algorithm against Job Descriptions (JDs), and shortlist candidates.  
HRs can view and manage all jobs within their company and see shortlisted candidates.  
Authentication is handled via **Firebase Google Sign-In** with role-based access control (Recruiter & HR).

## 🚀 MVP Flow

### Recruiter Flow
1. User selects **Recruiter** role.  
2. Sign in with Google → store Firebase token.  
3. Autofill **Name** and **Email** from token + autofill **Role** from earlier selection.  
4. Enter **Company Name**.  
5. Click **Register** → backend flow:
   - Check if company exists.  
     - ❌ If not found → return error: *Company not found*.  
     - ✅ If found → verify token, then store user (`name`, `email`, `company_id`, `role`) in DB.  
6. Recruiter options after login:
   - **Create Job** or **Upload Resumes**.  
   - Must create/select a job before uploading resumes.  
   - Upload resumes (limit: 20 per batch).  
   - Backend uploads resumes to S3 → parses → stores in DB one by one:  
     ```
     candidate_id (PK), recruiter_id (FK), job_id (FK), resume_url,
     resume_text (parsed), created_at, status (shortlisted: true/false)
     ```
   - Run matching algorithm to shortlist candidates.  
   - Apply filters (e.g., CGPA > 7).  

### HR Flow
1. User selects **HR** role.  
2. Sign in with Google → store Firebase token.  
3. Autofill **Name** and **Email** from token + autofill **Role** from earlier selection.  
4. Enter **Company Name**.  
5. Click **Register** → backend flow:
   - Check if company exists.  
     - ✅ If found → return error: *Company already exists*.  
     - ❌ If not found → verify token, create new company, then store HR user in DB.  
6. HR after login:  
   - View **all jobs** created by recruiters from their company.  
   - View shortlisted candidates.

## 🔑 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

- **Recruiter:**  
  - Upload resumes  
  - Create JDs  
  - Run matching algorithm  
  - Shortlist candidates  

- **HR:**  
  - View all jobs in their company  
  - View shortlisted candidates  
  - Manage interviews  

RBAC is enforced via **Firebase Custom Claims**.  
The backend verifies roles before allowing API access.

## 📌 Notes

- MVP supports **1 HR per company** but allows **many Recruiters**.  
- `firebase_uid` is stored in DB for secure token verification & user mapping.  
- Constraints:  
  - `UNIQUE(company_name)` on companies table.  
  - `UNIQUE(firebase_uid)` on users table.
